## [Unreleased]

## [2024-12-04]

### Added
- **Document Parsing Support:** Comprehensive parsing for PDF, Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files integrated into the WebSocket tagged file handler
- **File & Conversation Tagging:** Ctrl+left-click interaction to tag files and conversations for AI context injection
  - Mixed type support with `type` field ("file" | "conversation")
  - System prompt hierarchy: FILES → CONVERSATIONS → RAG CONTEXT
  - `@{filename}` stored in database, `[filename]` badges displayed in UI
- **FileViewer Large Icons View:**
  - Image thumbnails using `/api/files/:id/view` endpoint
  - File type icons for non-image files
  - 6-level mouse wheel zoom (64px, 96px, 128px, 160px, 192px, 256px)
  - Default size: 128px (index 2)
- **Chat Message Animations:** Smooth fade-in animations for natural message transitions

### Fixed
- **Chat Streaming UX:** Proper `await queryClient.invalidateQueries()` before clearing streaming state to prevent message flicker
- **Toast Notifications:** Auto-dismiss after 1 second for less intrusive feedback
- **Wheel Zoom Browser Interference:** Event capture phase (`capture: true`) on ScrollArea parent container prevents browser Ctrl+Wheel zoom from interfering with icon size adjustment

### Technical Details
- Wheel zoom uses `scrollContainerRef` wrapping ScrollArea with `overflow-hidden`
- Always invalidate `/api/subscription` when project/conversation counts change
- ICON_SIZES constant: `[64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256]`
